# PeakMan

PeakMan is an easy-to-use and fast peak detection and artifact processing tool for electrocardiogram data.

It builds upon a [peak detection algorithm](http://www.billauer.co.il/peakdet.html) by Eli Billauer and features local and global thresholding for R waves.

The application is written in C++ using the Qt framework and runs on all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS X and Linux). [QCustomPlot](http://qcustomplot.com/) is used for data visualization.
